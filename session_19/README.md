# nanoGPT
### Building GPT: Text generator based on Shakespeare literature
This code is based on the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=kH6M-zzhoK_lbqLW) by Andrej Karpathy. 

The model uses characters as tokens and trains by using attention layer along with residual connections and dropout layer.

#### Files
- `input.txt` contains literature by Shakespeare
- `nano_gpt.py` has the model and supporting functionality to train the model
- Other files, `bigram.py` and `gpt_dev.ipynb` contain the code used during preparation of this repo

#### Dependancies
- PyTorch
